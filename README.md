# MediaFileAudioTracksMerger

Example of using FFMpeg API to mix a few audio streams into one.

The project is focusing to help diving into FFMpeg API especially audio transcoding and filtering, how it works and how to use it. FFMpeg is powerful tool and allow rich set of manipulation on medea content from standallon (CMD tool) application, but from my perspective specs of the library is not detailed, and sometimes it is required a lot of time to implement some feature. 
Sometimes example works better then specs.

## How to build

To build the app:
1. Run script /thirdparty/ffmpeg/general/build-ffmpeg.sh (prefered version of ffmpeg is 4.2.2)
2. Run xcode project.
3. Select sample from menu.
